# ComicStreamerSharp
A C# Library to talk to a ComicStreamer database.

See https://github.com/ForceConstant/ComicStreamerSharp/blob/master/UnitTest1.cs for examples.


Utilizes ComicStreamer server at https://github.com/beville/ComicStreamer to be able to stream server based comics to a client.  Can provide whole archives and individual pages. 

I also have made a java/android version: https://github.com/ForceConstant/ComicStreamerAndroid which is currently being developed.
 
Note I am doing C# development at the moment, so I may never update this library, but maybe someone can use this.
